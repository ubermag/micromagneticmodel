## About

`micromagneticmodel` is a Python package that provides:

- Interface for for micromagnetic simulation tools

- Mechanism for defining micromagnetic system, its Hamiltonian, and its dynamics equation

It is available on all major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and requires Python 3.5 or higher.

## Installation, testing, and upgrade

We support installation using `conda` and `pip` package managers. Instructions can be found [here](https://micromagneticmodel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ipynb/00-tutorial-installation-testing-upgrade.html).

## Binder

This package can be used in the cloud via Binder. This does not require you to have anything installed and no files will be created on your machine. To access Binder, use this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ubermag/micromagneticmodel/master?filepath=docs%2Fipynb%2Findex.ipynb).

## Documentation

Documentation is available [here](https://micromagneticmodel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), where APIs and tutorials as Jupyter notebooks are available.
